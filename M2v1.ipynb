    "### Постановка задачи\n",
    "\n",
    "Просмотр фильмов на оригинальном языке - это популярный и действенный метод обучения иностранным языкам. Важно выбрать фильм, который подходит студенту по уровню сложности, т.е. студент понимал бы 50-70 % диалогов. Чтобы выполнить это условие, преподаватель должен посмотреть фильм и решить, какому уровню он соответствует. Однако это требует больших временных затрат.\n",
